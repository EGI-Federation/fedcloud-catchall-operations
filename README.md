# fedcloud-catchall-operations

Operation of fedcloud integration components for selected providers.

## Site Configuration

This repository consists of the main configuration for the fedcloud catchall
operations. For every endpoint, a file in the `sites` directory should describe
its configuration with a format as follows:

```yaml
gocdb: <name in gocdb of the site>
endpoint: <keystone endpoint of the site>
# optionally specify a protocol for the Keystone V3 federation API
protocol: openid | oidc (default is openid)
# optionally specify a region name if using different regions
region: myregion
vos:
  # List of VOs defined as follows
  - name: <vo name>
    auth:
      project_id: <project id supporting the VO vo name at the site>
    # any other optional configuration for cloud-info-provider, e.g:
    # not really used for now
    defaultNetwork: private | public | private_only |Â public_only
    publicNetwork: <name of the public network>
```

## Generating configurations

The mapping configuration of the VOs supported at each site can be easily
generated with the `generate-config.py` utility (requires `pyyaml`). It takes as
parameter the YAML file describing the site and will dump the requested
keystone, caso or cloudkeeper-os json config:

```shell
python generate-config.py --config-type keystone sites/SITE.yaml
```

This mapping file should work for most cases. If you have special requirements
open an issue so we can tune the generation to meet your needs!

## Docker containers

Components are run as docker containers, which if not available upstream, are
generated in this repository.

## Deployment

Deployment is managed on a separate private repository that includes several
secrets. Deployment is done with ansible using a
[dedicated role](https://github.com/EGI-Federation/ansible-role-fedcloud-ops)
with:

```sh
ansible-playbook -i inventory.yaml --extra-vars "@secrets.yaml" playbook.yaml
```

where:

- `inventory.yaml` contains the ansible inventory with the host to configure
- `secrets.yaml` contains the credentials for every configured VO and a valid
  token for the AMS
- `playbook.yaml` is an ansible playbook that just uses the
  `fedcloud-catchall-ops` role to configure the host
