# fedcloud-catchall-operations

Operation of fedcloud integration components for selected providers. 
This is a helm chart that will deploy the catchall operations for
the EGI federated cloud.

## What this does?

The chart will create:
- a cron job per site that will execute the cloud-info-provider for every 
  vo supporteb by the site and push the information to the AMS in order
  to be consumed by clients.
- a service per site and VO that will execute cloudkeeper-os to synchronise
  images pushed by cloudkeeper cron.
- a cron job per site and VO that executes cloudkeeper with the cloudkeeper-os
  service as backend to fetch the VO-wide image list from AppDB.

## Installing the chart

helm install -f sites.yaml -f secrets.yaml --name fedcloud fedcloud-ops
